<h1>About 4A Games</h1>
<p class="necoo">
    4A Games is a video game development studio known for its atmospheric first person shooters Metro 2033 and Metro: Last Light. The studio was established in 2005 by experienced game industry professionals with the aim of creating premium quality games for latest generation consoles and personal computers. All our experience, talent and enthusiasm go into creating games with deep story, unique gameplay elements and highly detailed believable environments. In addition to that, our in-house developed 4A Engine is constantly evolving with the latest industry trends and being highly scalable delivers a good performance on older devices while giving great looking picture on high-end machines.

    Currently at the heart of the company are around 80 talented designers, programmers, artists, sound specialists and writers, with years of experience in software development and computer games in particular. In fact, most of its employees were at the source of Ukraine’s game industry.

    Creative Director Andrey Prokhorov has this to say about the studio:
    “The Ukrainian game development industry was formed from self-taught people, enthusiasts who learned by trial and error. Coming from various backgrounds – engineers, musicians, movie directors, painters, scientists and even the military - this diversity gives our studio a certain uniqueness in the way we create games. All new people are carefully selected to fit perfectly into the team. We never pursue quantity to the prejudice of quality, and the smaller size of our studio allows for a unique creative process in a friendly atmosphere.”</p>
